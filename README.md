# Data and code used for Entanglement Transition in Rod Packings

## Example code to test the rod segmentation process
In 'scripts' folders, you can run the 'Example.m' script (open it on MATLAB, and hit F5). With MATLAB R2021b on my personal computer (Windows 10 platform, i7 processor and 32 GB ram), it usually takes an hour to complete the entire test. The figures produced from this script are stored in 'results' folder automatically.

## Z-stack image data
Preprocessed z-stack 3D images, as a 3D array of logical type, are stored in subfolders in the 'data' folder. They are stored in 'mat' files.
